        "The training process happening in ***model.fit()*** is really about tuning the internal variables of the networks to the best possible values, so that they can map the input to the output. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is achieved through an optimization process called **Gradient Descent**, which uses **Numeric Analysis** to find the best possible values to the internal variables of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Descent iteratively adjusts parameters, nudging them in the correct direction a bit at a time until they reach the best values. In this case “best values” means that nudging them any more would make the model perform worse. The function that measures how good or bad the model is during each iteration is called the “loss function”, and the goal of each nudge is to “minimize the loss function.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process starts with a forward pass, where the input data is fed to the neural network. Then the model applies its internal math on the input and internal variables to predict an answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a value is predicted, the difference between that predicted value and the correct value is calculated. This difference is called the loss, and it's a measure of how well the model performed the mapping task. The value of the loss is calculated using a loss function, which we specified with the loss parameter when calling ***model.compile()***.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the loss is calculated, the internal variables (weights and biases) of all the layers of the neural network are adjusted, so as to minimize this loss — that is, to make the output value closer to the correct value.\n",
        "\n",
        "This optimization process is called Gradient Descent. The specific algorithm used to calculate the new value of each internal variable is specified by the optimizer parameter when calling ***model.compile()***. \n",
